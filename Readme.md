You need the custom firmware for your device.

RS97:
Only the RetroFW 1.1 and later is supported

Install the provided ipk like any other emulator.
If you want to launch directly into PyMenu, run installer/install.dge with an app like commander.

Currently only the default gmenu2x is capable of installing new ipk packages!
