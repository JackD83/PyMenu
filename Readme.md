Menu System for the RS97 and PAP KIII Plus

Currently only runnung on the RS97

Installation RS97:

1. You need the custom firmware for your device. Follow the guides listed here:
https://jutleys.wixsite.com/retrogamers97-90

I recomend the external version

2. Clone or copy the files from this repo besides teh gmenu2x folder. (Can only be accessed by using a cardreader. Gmenu2x has its own partition)
3. run python/install.dge to install python

4. PyMenu can be run by starting PyMenu/run.sh

5. If you want to make it your default launcher, run installer/install.dge. This can currently only be undone by reflashing the cfw

Tested on cfw 2.0
